<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Pressure Type</li><li>Constant Volume Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial respirators are medical devices used to assist patients with breathing difficulties. Constant pressure type respirators deliver air at a preset pressure, adjusting the volume of air based on the patient's lung capacity. Constant volume type respirators deliver a fixed volume of air with each breath, maintaining a consistent flow. Both types of respirators are vital tools in intensive care units to provide mechanical ventilation to patients with respiratory failure. They help ensure that patients receive adequate oxygen levels and support their breathing function.</p></p>
