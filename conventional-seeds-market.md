<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional Seeds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Herbicide-tolerance (HT)</li><li>Insect-resistance (IR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional seeds are typically categorized into two main market types: herbicide-tolerance (HT) and insect-resistance (IR). HT seeds are genetically engineered to withstand specific herbicides, allowing farmers to easily control weeds without harming their crops. On the other hand, IR seeds are designed to produce their own toxins that deter insects from feeding on the plant. Both types of seeds offer farmers sustainable and cost-effective solutions to manage pests and weeds in their fields, ultimately increasing crop yields.</p></p>
