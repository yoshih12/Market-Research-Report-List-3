They are often used in scenarios where a more compact design is needed. Straight type humidifiers, on the other hand, have a straight tube that allows for a more direct airflow. They are commonly used in situations where a longer tubing length is required. Both types serve the same purpose of providing humidified air to patients during respiratory therapy.</p></p>
