<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ICD</li><li>Pacemaker</li><li>CRT-D</li><li>CRT-P</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable Cardiac Stimulators, including Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), Pacemakers, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps), are devices used to manage heart rhythm disorders. ICDs monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks to correct abnormal rhythms. Pacemakers regulate heart rate by sending electrical impulses to the heart. CRT-Ds and CRT-Ps are designed to treat heart failure by coordinating the contractions of the heart's lower chambers. These devices play a crucial role in improving the quality of life for patients with cardiac conditions.</p></p>
