<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Metrology Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Equipment</li><li>Contactless Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical metrology equipment is divided into two main types: contact equipment and contactless equipment. Contact equipment involves physical contact between the measuring device and the object being measured, allowing for precise measurements but potentially causing damage or wear on the object. In contrast, contactless equipment uses methods such as laser or light-based technology to measure objects without making physical contact, which is ideal for delicate or sensitive surfaces. Both types of equipment have their own advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
