<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Outdoor Step Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Sensor</li><li>Vibration Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Outdoor step sensors are available in two main types: gravity sensors and vibration sensors. Gravity sensors use the force of gravity to detect changes in elevation and movement, making them ideal for tracking steps outdoors. Vibration sensors, on the other hand, use vibrations caused by movement to calculate steps taken. Both types of sensors are commonly used in fitness trackers and smartwatches to provide accurate step counts while exercising or walking outdoors.</p></p>
