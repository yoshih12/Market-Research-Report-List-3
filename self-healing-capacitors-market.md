<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Axial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-healing capacitors come in two main types: radial and axial. Radial capacitors have leads that come out from the bottom and are bent at a right angle to the body, making them suitable for through-hole mounting. On the other hand, axial capacitors have leads that are found on each end of the body and are ideal for surface mounting applications. Both types of self-healing capacitors are designed to automatically repair defects caused by voltage surges, ensuring longer lifespan and improved performance.</p></p>
