<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Packaged HVAC System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Systems</li><li>Water-Cooled Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single packaged HVAC systems are available in two main types: Air-cooled systems and Water-cooled systems. Air-cooled systems use outdoor air to remove heat from the refrigerant, while water-cooled systems use water to cool the refrigerant before circulating it back through the system. Air-cooled systems are more common in residential and small commercial buildings, while water-cooled systems are often found in larger commercial and industrial applications where higher cooling capacities are needed. Both types offer efficient and effective cooling options for various types of buildings.</p></p>
