<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Recycling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Processing</li><li>Continuous Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent recycling systems are available in two main types: batch processing and continuous processing. </p><p>In batch processing, solvents are collected and processed in batches, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the recycling process. This type is suitable for smaller quantities of solvents or when different types of solvents need to be recycled separately.</p><p>Continuous processing, on the other hand, involves a continuous flow of solvents through the recycling system, offering higher efficiency and throughput for larger quantities of solvent. This type is ideal for industrial settings with high solvent usage.</p></p>
