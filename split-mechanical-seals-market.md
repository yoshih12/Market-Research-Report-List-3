<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Split Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Split mechanical seals are categorized into two main types: pusher type seal and non-pusher seal. Pusher type seals have a dynamic secondary seal that moves along with the primary sealing surface. This design helps to maintain proper contact pressure and reduce leakage. On the other hand, non-pusher seals do not have a dynamic secondary seal and rely on the stationary design for sealing effectiveness. Both types cater to different sealing requirements and are widely used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
