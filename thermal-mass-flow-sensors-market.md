<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Mass Flow Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal Mass Flow Sensors are used in various industries for measuring flow rates of gases and liquids. The market for these sensors can be divided into contact type and non-contact type. Contact type sensors come in direct contact with the fluid being measured, providing accurate results but may be subject to wear and tear. Non-contact type sensors measure flow rates without physically touching the fluid, making them suitable for applications where avoiding contamination or damage is a priority. Both types offer reliable and efficient flow measurement solutions for different industries.</p></p>
