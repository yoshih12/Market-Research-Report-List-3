<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Gas Sensor Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VOC gas sensor devices are commonly categorized into two main types: PID (photoionization detector) and metal-oxide semiconductor. PID sensors detect volatile organic compounds by measuring the ionization of gas molecules, making them ideal for detecting a wide range of VOCs. On the other hand, metal-oxide semiconductor sensors rely on changes in electrical conductivity when exposed to VOCs, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for detecting harmful gases. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in ensuring safe indoor air quality and monitoring environmental pollution levels.</p></p>
