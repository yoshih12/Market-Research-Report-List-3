<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless VOC Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wireless VOC meters are devices used to monitor and measure volatile organic compounds in the air. There are two main types of VOC meters in the market - PID (photoionization detector) and metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. PID meters use ultraviolet light to ionize VOCs, providing accurate readings across a wide range of compounds. On the other hand, metal-oxide semiconductor sensors rely on changes in resistance to detect VOCs, making them cost-effective and ideal for continuous monitoring in industrial settings. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring air quality and safety in various industries.</p></p>
